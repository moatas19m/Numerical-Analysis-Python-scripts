# Numerical-Analysis-Python-scripts
Python scripts for approximating the solutions to different functions.

A series of homework assignments and team projects (which I chose to do solo ofc XD) for my Numerical Analysis course 
in the 3rd semester of my BS-CS program at IBA, Karachi, taught by Dr. Abdul Majid.

Just install python3 and run the files, either from terminal or in an IDE.
